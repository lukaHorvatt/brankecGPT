A very simple frontend only project with static quiz.

Made as a wedding challenge for Brane and Petra but also as an excercise in using chatGPT to code a slightly more complicated and customized app.

This app was 95% "coded" throug the chatGPT public interface, without using any plugins. Manual changes were mainly done around using URLs for images and changing wording on few places.
